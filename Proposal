# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Sweet Defense

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")	
A game consisting of towers of pastries that attack incoming customers, satiating their hunger. Defend the towers until the game is over.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The software will be an executable file that opens our game. The game will prompt the user to create a character and assign an objective to them. The objective is to defend entities on the plane from other entities that are programmed to destroy or eliminate the initial ones. There will be character interactions, and most actions will be done through a point and click interaction or typing interaction by the user. It will most likely be done through a Game Engine, it will make the coding significantly easier, but it does not change the fact that we will have to learn the library to use it appropriately and efficiently. Thinking about doing it through PyGames or using some other type of Game Engine.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Caohoc Nguyen (tun57054@temple.edu) from Section 007 under TA Sai Shi, Jerry Huang (tun45399@temple.edu) from Section 009 under TA Joanne Nichols.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
-	Character creation
-	Textures
-	Tower code
-	Plane (using x,y coordinates)
-	Sounds (sources will be cited)
-	And more

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
-	Basic Function of a Game
-	Start and End
-	Sounds
-	Characters
-	And more

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
-Completion of the game
-Secret ending
-Easter eggs
-Presentation
-And more

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
The new skills we need to acquire is how to program and code a game from scratch, but the concept of the game is non-original. Topics that may be included in our research are: Game engines, simple AI, incorporating textures, creating nodes, creating characters, and assigning functions to them. We will have to find and allocate the time to create our game. The skills we will be learning will be mostly new things, although we will be able to incorporate what we learned to translate over to our game. Finding the per Caohoc will be doing the design of characters and coding character movements. I will be coding the towers, upgrades, and try to code a simple ai. We plan to make ourselves do more as we progress more into the development of our game. Currently still in the brainstorming phase.
