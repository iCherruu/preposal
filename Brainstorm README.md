#Preposal-with-Groupmates
Preposal and Github Lab 
My group is made up of myself, Jerry Huang from Section 009 and Caohoc Nguyen from Section 007.
Here's our thoughts or ideas on what we would like to do with this project:
  -Visual Novel Games
  -Click & Point Puzzle Games
  -Cooking Game (sort of like a diner dash theme with of course a twist)
  -Or possibly a mobile app game or utility
Right now we are leaning towards a cooking game or simulator.
We have some implementations we were thinking of:
  -Creating items that are unlockable through certain actions, thus creating an alternate ending to the main scenario.
  -Implementing an options page to change audio and other devices' settings.
  -Character customizations.
  -Creating certain interactions with characters and the outcome of each interaction.
  -Making a mistake can ensue an odd or unexpected ending.
These apply to the three ideas we have above, as for the possibility of a mobile utility app, we really haven't quite thought of much regarding it because it was not something we were considering.
There will be more ideas and additional implementations as we figure out what we will be doing.
